# Lightfriend
This is a lightfriend cloud repo that runs at this moment in lightfriend.ai. 

This is a bit tricky to self host at the moment since it requires setting up matrix server as well as bridges to different messaging providers. It also requires getting api keys from openrouter as well as phone number from twilio.
I'm working on a self hostable version at [github.com/ahtavarasmus/lightfriend](https://github.com/ahtavarasmus/lightfriend)
